			<h1>About</h1>
			<h2>About Me</h2>
			I want to formally introduce myself now and say hello my name is Haley and I am a 18 year old about to be 19 and I am a college student working towards my Associates Degree and then moving on to my Bachelors Degree in the near future. I am not sure about what I exactly want to do as a career but I do enjoy being at the beach and being with animals so I will see what happens when it comes my way. I have a large passion for animals large and small except for a few, I have showed dairy cows for nine years and recently stopped since I am in college now, but I do want to get back into that at some point in my life. 
			<br><br>So some background information about me or the person who is behind the extremely large rabbitry that some of you aspire to be and who can do it with skill and patience. I was born and adopted from China, I have been in the United States since then I call Florida my home it fits my outdoors type of lifestyle and offers a wide variety of beaches to go to which is my favorite. I have a hobby of taking photos of anything but particularly my animals and the occasional great sunsets I have two outstanding but also loving dogs named Maisy thats a Fox Red Labrador Retriever and she is 9 years old, I also have a German Shepherd that is a year and a few months old. He is my social media guinea pig for when I take photos when I have time to or when I am free from school work and family things.

			<h2>About the Rabbitry</h2>
			Hello, and Welcome to one of the largest rabbitries in LL’s community which is a SIM which is a SIM rabbit breeding game. We were originally established under the name Haley Nicholle’s Rabbitry in <b>1/03/2017</b>. As a very small rabbitry learning how to play the game since we were introduced by a friend, once we first started we breed under the breeding prefix <b>HNR</b> when we were able to register our first 10 litters to get a breeding prefix then we changed our name for the second time to Haley Nicholle’s Lops in  2017 once again due to us breeding English Lops as our main breed which we had changed our breeding prefix to <b>HNLOP</b>. In the beginning of the new year of 2018 we were fortunate to buy credits to expand our rabbitry the way you see it as today, during this time we also helped others expand as well. After all of the name changes we finally needed to settle for a new rabbitry name that fit us, our final name change was made on <b>5/12/2018.</b> to what it is now <b>Dairyland Bunnies Inc.</b> this name was selected from a contest that I held for a new rabbitry name and also breeding prefix which we now use <b>CATTL</b>.
			<br><br>As you see the rabbitry that we have today, we could not have so successful or even be possible without the wonderful different breeders within LL that has helped us, we have switched our original breed which we did over a year which was English Lops, which we still have some that linger within our hutches for show purposes, but since then we have transitioned our main focus and which is our main breed to Holland Lops which now our rabbitry is filled with them.
