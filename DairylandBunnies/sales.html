			<h2>Buying Policies</h2>
			I often restock my rabbitry a lot since I have does in my rabbitry that age really fast, I tend to pick breeders with different lines than I do to allow the room for non-inbreeding which I started almost two years ago which I am still successful to this day with only one or two inbred litters which I cull immediately. I tend to purchase a large amount of rabbits at one time since I like to keep it stocked with fresh blood when ever I can find some.
			<br><br>I am trying out a new tactic with my restocking almost every week or when I can find high quality rabbits, I am offering a group rate for a large amount of animals that I buy from a breeder. The link below explains in full detail how the pricing goes and also the policies that goes with it.
			<br><br>View our group rate pricing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHu_OykBonX-pQ_XzKODWtlHuRwCijrgdaKgTU1hLsA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
