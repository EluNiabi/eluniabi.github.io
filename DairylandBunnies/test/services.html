				<h2>Kit Holding</h2>
				<p>This is the only service that my rabbitry offers to help people who want to keep their extra kits if they can not keep more kits than they already have reserved for themselves already in their rabbitry that they want to keep for their projects. This service does come with two different fees with it since I am using up my space that I have designated for holding kits. Since I tend to have a lot of space open in my rabbitry I am now open to holding peoples rabbits for up until a week at maximum unless we have spoken otherwise.
				<br><br>Each rabbit(s) will cost $30 to have a spot in my rabbitry 
				<br><br>Each kit(s)  that I hold will cost $25 to have a spot in my rabbitry
				<br><br>The way this works is you reserve the kit or rabbit for me and I will hold it until the kit ages out which is 4 months of age, unless we have talked otherwise. Once those 4 days are up I will reserve the rabbit for you and that's when the fee will be paid.
				<br><br>If for some reason do not pick up the rabbit within the week limit without notifying me I will put it down if it is not a breed that I have or if its a breed that I have I will use it in my breeding programs. It is not fair to me if I have an unclaimed rabbit for over a week without notice and using my funds to care for it and such.
				<br><br>You will get 4 warnings/messages before actions are taken that I have explained above
				<br><br>Day of pick up: if you pick up your rabbits on time we can continue to work together if you do not notify me that you need more time and extra days
				<br><br><b>First Warning:</b> If you have not picked it up during the day or after the next roll over I will message you asking you nicely to come pick up your rabbit(s).
				<br><b>Second Warning:</b> After I have sent you the first message I will message you again to come pick up your rabbit(s) nicely.
				<br><b>Third Warning:</b> This  next message will notify you that you are on your last day of notification and also the warning that you may not be allowed to use my kit or rabbit services again.
				<br><b>Fourth and final Warning:</b> I will message you one final time to come get your rabbits or you will be blocked from communicating with me. After the 4 messages have been sent this will stop all communications and your rabbits will be put down or be used in my breeding project.</p>

				<h2>Studding</h2>
				<p>Here at Dairyland Bunnies Inc. we offer some studs that people can use to increase their project goals. We do not have all of our bucks up for stud because we do not offer our own animals up for stud just yet, we only have a few studs up for studs at one time, which is our higher stat rabbits are up for private stud only. Rabbits that have over 3,000 in stats will be put up for stud first, then the next set of bucks that are close 3,000 will be put up next.
				<br><br>If you see a rabbit that you want to use as a stud that is not used for a stud please PM us and maybe we can work out a deal. We cannot guarantee that all rabbits that you ask to use will be put up for stud at your request but we will work with you at our utmost ability to fulfil your request.
				<br><br>We will soon open our studding to more rabbits once we raise some of our rabbits stats a little bit higher, this will include rabbits under 2,900 in stats for possibly public studs.</p>
