		<h1>Our Projects</h1>
		For our rabbitry we have multiple projects going on at once it may seem like a cluster mess within our rabbitry since we sort our rabbits by breed not by project because that takes way to much time and wasted space within our hutches. We have four main projects and then one side project  within our rabbitry as a whole which may seem a lot to many of you, but to us it is very easy to spot when we go through our hutches.
		<h2>The Breeds</h2>
		Even though our rabbitry is enormous we have fallen in love with two different unique breeds which offer many opportunities for growth and also colors to choose from which are the Holland Lop and the New Zealand Rabbit. We have grown our love for them over the course of time, our most favorite is the Holland Lop because of their floppy ears and all of the colors that they can come in. 
		<br><br>Our main breed for our rabbitry is the the Holland Lop which our main goal for this breed is working towards to raise stats above 3,000 for each individual rabbit, even our retired does are included in this goal and also obtaining high stats at birth when we have litters.
		<br><br>With this breed we also do some colors breeding as well working with Fawns, Dilute Fawns, Broken Fawns, Broken Tri- Color, Tri- Color variations, Harlequin variations, and many more colors to offer more variety. We often have a hoard of a certain color to have a higher chance for breeding a Harlequin or a Tri-Color rabbit which is our favorite colors.
		<br><br>With our color breeding program within our Holland Lops we are striving to have the highest stats possible with each color that we have this also includes our retired ladies as well. We will also give them items to boost their stats if need be if they are close to a certain number.
		<br><br>In our rabbitry this is our side breed which means that we are not that active in this breed as much as our main breed the Holland Lop, although we are still in love with the breed which is the New Zealand Rabbit. We would consider these guys as they big fluffy guys of our rabbitry that we like to look at the markings that they have and also the color.
		<br><br>We have bred these in the past with huge success, so we decided to bring them back in our rabbitry but in a little bit different way.This time we want to limit the amount of a certain color that we have which is the broken blue color, in the past we mostly bred these so now we want to breed just Blue New Zealand Rabbits. Soon some of our rabbits will be up for stud once we get the stats high enough.
		<br><br>We are doing this breed to increase stats up to 2,000 in stats for each rabbit that we have this is our main goal for this breed while we also have another goal. Our second goal for this breed for us is to freshen up our color breeding skills which we are very rusty on, for our end result we want to breed primarily Blue and Broken Blue rabbits with very little Broken Black and Black rabbits in our hutches that carry on the blue gene.
		<br><br>We want to say a huge thank you to Niabi for helping us establish our stock and also for helping us guide us on coloring breeding!
		<h3>Holland Lop</h3>
		<b>Stats</b>
		<br>When ranking these for priority I would put this at the top of the list for our rabbitry, not just because this is our main breed but we want to remain on the leaderboards with our stock and also the ones that we own but were not bred by us. This has been an ongoing project but we are almost their and we are excited to say that we do have one with our breeding prefix and that means the world to us that we are capable to do something like that.
		<br><br><b>Color Breeding</b>
			<ul>
				<li>blue harlequin</li>
				<li>lilac harlequin</li>
				<li>harlequin</li>
				<li>chocolate harlequin</li>
				<li>tri-color (white/lilac/fawn)</li>

				<li>silver</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>New Zealand</h3>
		<b>Stats</b>
		<br>With this project we are just solely working on raising stats for our New Zealand, our ultimate goal for this project is to raise all of rabbits stats up to 2,000. We will increase our goal when we meet this first goal of ours. Once we get our stats up we will consider putting our bucks up for stud, but not just yet.
		<br><br><b>Color Breeding</b>
		<br>This project may seem very easy but for us since we are not a sole color breeder we will be researching and also having help within the community to begin our project. 
		<h3>Side Project</h3>
	Since we have a full list of major projects that we are focusing on at once we have put our project of getting high birth stats as a side project, to achieve this project we need to accomplish one of our main projects which is to raise our rabbits stats.
	<br><br>Our goal for this project is to to have birth stats above 2,000 for our HL rabbits. Then hopefully have over 1,000 in birth stats for our New Zealand Rabbits.
