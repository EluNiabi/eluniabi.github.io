		<h2>Rabbitry Policies</h2>
			My rabbitry policies do change quite often since I do change my projects a lot to keep myself from getting bored and also it allows me to freshen up some of my skills within the game since I have come back from a break.
			<br><br>The link below will fully explain my rabbitries policies in depth

			If you have any questions about these policies please pm us.
		<h2>Buying Policies</h2>
			I often restock my rabbitry a lot since I have does in my rabbitry that age really fast, I tend to pick breeders with different lines than I do to allow the room for non-inbreeding which I started almost two years ago which I am still successful to this day with only one or two inbred litters which I cull immediately. I tend to purchase a large amount of rabbits at one time since I like to keep it stocked with fresh blood when ever I can find some.
			<br><br>I am trying out a new tactic with my restocking almost every week or when I can find high quality rabbits, I am offering a group rate for a large amount of animals that I buy from a breeder. The link below explains in full detail how the pricing goes and also the policies that goes with it.

		<h2>Messaging Policies</h2>
			Since we are a rabbitry that is very large I am very busy behind the scenes of my rabbitry to bring to you what you may see if you see my profile, I tend to be online a lot during the day if I have nothing else to do and I am not busy.When I am not busy I use my laptop to play which allows us to see everything in a bigger picture. I do check my messages all day long. So if you do message me I will see it and answer it as soon as I can.
			<br><br>If am busy during the day I tend to check my messages in the morning when I first log on and then whenever I can during the day, I tend to use my phone if I am busy or I am out with the family. When I am busy I a, only spending a few minutes with each time I log in so I do tend to miss some of my messages so during this time please be patient with me I will get to you.
			<br><br>When I am at home I use my phone to play unless I have the time to pull out my laptop then I leave it logged in all day and I play all day.
			<br><br>Two things I do not tolerate when I am messaging someone is begging for things and also being rude towards me.
			<br><br>I do my very best to be nice to you so I expect the same thing from you. I also talk to people like an adult, although not everyone is an adult I would like to be treated like an adult not like a child
			<br><br>I am here to try to help you not argue with you so if you come off rude I will leave the message alone for a bit and come back to it.
