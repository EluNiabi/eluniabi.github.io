		<h1>About Us</h1>
		I want to formally introduce myself now and say hello my name is Haley and I am a 18 year old about to be 19 and I am a college student working towards my Associates Degree and then moving on to my Bachelors Degree in the near future. I am not sure about what I exactly want to do as a career but I do enjoy being at the beach and being with animals so I will see what happens when it comes my way. I have a large passion for animals large and small except for a few, I have showed dairy cows for nine years and recently stopped since I am in college now, but I do want to get back into that at some point in my life. 
		<br><br>So some background information about me or the person who is behind the extremely large rabbitry that some of you aspire to be and who can do it with skill and patience. I was born and adopted from China, I have been in the United States since then I call Florida my home it fits my outdoors type of lifestyle and offers a wide variety of beaches to go to which is my favorite. I have a hobby of taking photos of anything but particularly my animals and the occasional great sunsets I have two outstanding but also loving dogs named Maisy thats a Fox Red Labrador Retriever and she is 9 years old, I also have a German Shepherd that is a year and a few months old. He is my social media guinea pig for when I take photos when I have time to or when I am free from school work and family things.
		<h3>Rabbitry Hours</h3>
		I have just came back from a break due to school, but since I am on break for the winter we have had the time to be active once again. Since my rabbitry does have a lot of rabbits we are on a lot many times during the day checking in on our rabbitry. The daily routine to run my rabbitry consists of : looking for any missed messages from the night before, treating our animals of any illnesses or routine vet care,vet sexing new litters that might have arrived after rollover, caring for my animals, participating in shows this includes group shows and agility with all of my animals, leveling up animals after shows,setting up breedings between my animals, and updating stats when I can.
		<br><br>My goal for the new year is to be active daily when I go back to school so I can continue my projects and also see where my rabbitry takes me for the new year.
